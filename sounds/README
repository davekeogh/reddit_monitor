RULES:
        Similar to those defined by gnome-audio, quoting Elliot Lee:

        <snip>
                The criteria for sound inclusion:
                . No licensing issues
                . Appropriate length
                        . Shorter than 1 second for any sound that denotes a specific event
                        . Shorter than 5 seconds for a background sound (basically, startup/shutdown)
                . Appropriate sound
                        . Volume
                        . Normalized between samples
                . Spectral range
                        . No extremes
                . Good taste
                        . KISS
                        . General common sense (hah!)
        </snip>

        Of course, in addition to this the Theming Spec not only requires
        normalized sounds, but those with with good perceived loudness as
        described in:
